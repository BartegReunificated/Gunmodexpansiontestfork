# NineZero's Gun Expansion
NineZero's Gun Expansion is an addon mod for MrCrayfish's Gun Mod that adds additional weapons and attachments in an aesthetically simple style.

### Addon Features:
* Eight new weapons to use. By default, these weapons are balanced to fit in with the default CGM weapons.
* One ammo item: the Medium Bullet, used by some of the rifles in this addon.
* An assortment of attachments, including barrels, stocks, a sight, and a grip.
* Crafting recipes for all items, allowing them to be used in survival mode.

This addon and github page are both a work in progress - more changes and updates can be expected in the future.

### Planned Additions:
* Ports to 1.19.3, 1.18.2, and 1.16.5.
* More weapons, including two more shotgun types.
* At least one new attachment.
