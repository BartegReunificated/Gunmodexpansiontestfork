# NineZero's Gun Mod Addon
NineZero's Gun Mod Addon is an addon for MrCrayfish's Gun Mod that adds additional weapons and attachments in the style of the gun mod's original nine weapons.


### Addon Features:
* Currently seven weapons: the Revolver, Uzi, Submachine Gun, Heavy Assault Rifle, Battle Rifle, Hunting Rifle, and Sniper Rifle.
* One ammo item: the Medium Bullet, which is used by the Heavy Assault Rifle and Hunting Rifle.
* Three attachments: the Solid Stock, Stabilizing Stock, and a dyeable version of the Tactical Stock.
* Crafting recipes for all items, allowing them to be used in survival mode.

All weapons can be dyed and take attachments from the gun mod and this addon, and possibly other addons as well.
