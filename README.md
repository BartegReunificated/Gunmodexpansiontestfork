# NineZero's Gun Mod Addon
NineZero's Gun Mod Addon is an addon for MrCrayfish's Gun Mod that adds additional weapons and attachments in the style of the gun mod's original nine weapons.

### Addon Features:
* Currently seven weapons: the Revolver, Uzi, Submachine Gun, Heavy Assault Rifle, Battle Rifle, Hunting Rifle, and Sniper Rifle.
* One ammo item: the Medium Bullet, which is used by the Heavy Assault Rifle and Hunting Rifle.
* Three attachments: the Solid Stock, Stabilizing Stock, and a dyeable version of the Tactical Stock.
* Crafting recipes for all items, allowing them to be used in survival mode.

This addon and github page are both a work in progress - more changes and updates can be expected in the future.

### Currently Planned Additions:
* Hunting Shotgun, Double Barreled Shotgun, Infantry Rifle, and Machine Gun. Possibly other weapons later on.
* A few more attachments - sights, stocks, grips, etc.
* Animations for the Revolver.
